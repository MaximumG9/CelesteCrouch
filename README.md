# Up presses
First seen in the 2A TAS, up presses abuse input priority to make the game assume you are holding up. This can be written as: `1,D 1,U,D`. These feel cheap and like a bypass to pressing down, when creating TASes, these are only to be used when necessary. If two up presses are required next to each other they can be combined into one, but we should not abuse pressing up for long periods of time.
